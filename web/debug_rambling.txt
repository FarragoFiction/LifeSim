Alright.

I'm stumped.

I need to have the card creator sync to itself, but also need the number of results adn triggers
to be dynamic....

Oh. Wait.

No.

It's just an array of elements.

~~~~~~~~~

Why does it draw three times when i load the card from a string???

syncing template to data box
VM172:1 syncing everything to template
VM172:1 syncing data box to template
VM172:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate
VM172:1 syncing data box to template
VM172:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate
VM172:1 syncing data box to template
VM172:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate



okay more data:

syncing everything to template
VM196:1 syncing data box to template because syncEverythingToTemplate
VM196:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate
VM196:1 syncing template to data box
VM196:1 syncing everything to template
VM196:1 syncing data box to template because syncEverythingToTemplate
VM196:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate
VM196:1 syncing data box to template because SVPFormPairCreate
VM196:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate
VM196:1 syncing data box to template because SVPFormPairCreate
VM196:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate


AHAH there we go. SVP form pair create sets off a few more

SO....I think if i pass a bool for "sync" or not it'll fix.

i feel really sleepy.

so, I'm gonna need an extra push to finish this stuff.

First step: add a "money" section to the save data.
second step: display money on lifesim page.
third step: button to sell any card
fourth step: all the other library management shit (sorting, filtering, searching etc)
