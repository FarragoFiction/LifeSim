Alright.

I'm stumped.

I need to have the card creator sync to itself, but also need the number of results adn triggers
to be dynamic....

Oh. Wait.

No.

It's just an array of elements.

~~~~~~~~~

Why does it draw three times when i load the card from a string???

syncing template to data box
VM172:1 syncing everything to template
VM172:1 syncing data box to template
VM172:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate
VM172:1 syncing data box to template
VM172:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate

okay more data:

syncing everything to template
VM196:1 syncing data box to template because syncEverythingToTemplate
VM196:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate
VM196:1 syncing template to data box
VM196:1 syncing everything to template
VM196:1 syncing data box to template because syncEverythingToTemplate
VM196:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate
VM196:1 syncing data box to template because SVPFormPairCreate
VM196:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate
VM196:1 syncing data box to template because SVPFormPairCreate
VM196:1 drawing card because of syncDataBoxToTemplate


AHAH there we go. SVP form pair create sets off a few more

SO....I think if i pass a bool for "sync" or not it'll fix.

i feel really sleepy.

so, I'm gonna need an extra push to finish this stuff.

First step: add a "money" section to the save data.
second step: display money on lifesim page.
third step: button to sell any card
fourth step: all the other library management shit (sorting, filtering, searching etc)

~~~~

okay, next step is to display not the ENTIRE library, but  a subset.

maybe look through wiggler sim to see how i want to handle it.

Should ALWAYS be paginated.  But WHAT is paginated should vary.

wait. this is scope creep right now. I have to finish today, and I HAVE to finish tomorrow so...

I need to think about what I need.... (5 minutes on the clock)

The problem I'm trying to solve is:

* There are going to be a FUCK TON more cards than will be useful.
* It will be annoying to decide which cards to turn on or off.
* It will be annoying to figure out how to activate certain cards in the sim.

Cards are activated through stats. So you might have a "THOT" trigger card and want to find
any card that has a result involving THOT.

You'll want buttons for turning on ALL cards, NO cards, or RANDOM cards... ( no matter what is displayed?)

What if there's a particular card you want to try to see?

I know PL has search code for the image browser....

So maybe...

A text box, and a drop down for which field to check (name, found, trigger stat or result stat, unlock scene?).

Then a button for filter? Then a button for select all, select none and select random.
