        <b>What is it???</b><br><br>
        LifeSim is an homage to <a href = 'http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4'>Problem Sleuth's</a> <a href = 'http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4&p=001484'>Game of Life</a>. I am confident that this is the single best fan Problem Sleuth anything in existance. ... And if I'm wrong I'm hella interested to hear about my rivals.

        <br><Br>That said, the narrative mechanic here is dead fucking simple. You can see it right on the scene cards. Scenes have trigger conditions (like a stat being greater than, less than or equal to some value) and have results when they finish.

        <br><br>

        <b>What do I do with it???</b><br><br>
        LifeSim has two core gameplay loops:
            <ol>
                <li>Turn scenes on and off and see how that <a href = 'index.html'>changes</a> the Protagonist of LifeSim. Scenes chosen effect what is possible, but are not guaranteed to happen.  Will they go to college, find love, die in a fire, raise alien babies? Who knows!!!</li>
                <li><a href = 'collectScenes'>Collecting</a> more scenes to use to <span style = 'text-decoration: line-through'>torment</span> help the Protagonist. Scenes can be automatically unlocked in many places on Farrago Fiction, or you may find other ways to access them...</li>
            </ol>

    </li>

        <br><br>
    <li>

        <b>Wow. It's really cruel that you make me go looking for new Scenes.</b><br><br>
        Yes. It's almost as if. This April Fools + Easter update....is some sort of. Prankish. Easter Egg Hunt???
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href = 'gigglesnort.html'> Happy Hunting ;) ;) ;)</a>
    </li>
        <br><br>
    <li>

        <b>How will I know if I've found a new scene?</b><br><br>
        It'll be completely invisible to you, but if you check <a href = 'collectScenes.html'>the collection page</a> periodically you'll see if you have any new cards (and they'll tell you where you found them).
    </li>
    <br><br>
    </li>
        <br><br>

    <li>

        <b>What do I get if I find all the hidden scenes???</b><br><br>
        If anyone DOES manage to before 4/13/18, they'll be part of this years 4/13 HALL OF FAME!!! Your user name will go down in history as someone who likes finding easter eggs.
        <br><br>
        Proof will consist of screenshots of all the cards in your inventory, emailed to me or sent on discord, or on tumblr, whatever. If you're this good at finding eggs I'm sure you'll figure it out :) :) :)
        <br><br>
        I'm...kind of not expecting anyone to though? We'll see. You're all welcome to collaborate, though. Just remember, the more people who get in to the Hall of Fame, the less special it is ;) ;) ;)
    </li>

        <br><br>

    <li>

        <b>Okay. But finding all the hidden scenes is EASY. What else do you got for me???</b><br><br>
       Well, I mean, you could always try to actually VIEW all those scenes. Some of them might have p finicky trigger conditions, so that sounds like more of a challenge.
        <br><br>
        You can chart your progress <a href = 'viewAchievements.html'>here</a>, and any who view all the hidden scene by 6/12/18 get in a second Hall of Fame.

   </li>

            <b>What does money do?  I mean, excuse me. "Life Bux"???</b><br><br>
           Nothing Yet. ;) ;) ;)
